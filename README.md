ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Dashboard â€“ Power BI
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This Power BI project analyzes student performance data across multiple subjects, departments, and demographic factors.
It provides insights into overall performance, subject averages, pass/fail distribution, and performance gaps.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights and DAX Measures
1. Total Students

DAX Measure

Total Students = COUNTROWS(Sheet1)


Description: Counts the total number of students in the dataset.

2. Average Subject Scores

DAX Measures

Average Python Score   = AVERAGE(Sheet1[Python])
Average Math Score     = AVERAGE(Sheet1[Maths])
Average English Score  = AVERAGE(Sheet1[English])
Average EG Score       = AVERAGE(Sheet1[EngineeringGraphics])


Description: Calculates the average performance for each subject individually.

3. Overall Performance

DAX Measure:

Overall Performance = 
AVERAGE([Average Math Score]  + [Average EG Score]  + [Average English Score] + [Average Python Score]


Description: Evaluates the average performance of students across all four core subjects.

4. Performance Gap

DAX Measure

Performance Gap = [Average Math Score]   - [Average EG Score]   - [Average English Score]  - [Average Python Score]


Description: Highlights the gap in performance across subjects by comparing average Math scores with other subjects.

5. Pass Count

DAX Measure

PassCount = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sheet1), Sheet1[Result] = "Pass")


Description: Counts the number of students who passed all subjects.

6. Fail Count

DAX Measure

FailCount = CALCULATE( COUNTROWS(Sheet1),  Sheet1[Result] = "Fail")


Description: Counts the number of students who failed one or more subjects.
